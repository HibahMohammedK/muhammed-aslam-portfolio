# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website built using a Bootstrap template, customized to showcase my projects and skills.

## Template Credit
This project is based on the [Original Bootstrap DevFolio Template](https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/).  
All modifications and customization were done by me.

## What I Did / Customizations
- Replaced all template images with my own branding and visuals.  
- Added a LinkedIn link in the Contact section.  
- Added a "Download CV" button for easier access to my resume.  
- Modified the About section to reflect my personal profile.  
- Removed unnecessary pages from the template to create a **clean and minimal design**.  
- Added cross-platform support for favicons and Apple touch icons (dynamic favicon setup for browsers and mobile devices).  

## Features
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.  
- Clean, minimal layout highlighting my work and contact information.  
- Fully functional portfolio and contact sections.
